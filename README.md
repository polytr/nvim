# nvim
Nvim configuration for my stuff, a little slow on startup because of the lsp's
You know the deal. Remember to install:
- Every Mason lsp thing you want to use (some dont auto install)
- A nerdfont for the icons
- ripgrep
- nvim using the snap, (to get the oldest stable without being annoying)
- Everything else should auto-install
